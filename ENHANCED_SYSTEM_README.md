## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

### Basic Multi-Perspective Analysis
```python
from graph.multi_perspective_ensemble_graph import MultiPerspectiveEnsembleGraph

ensemble = MultiPerspectiveEnsembleGraph()

result = await ensemble.process_multi_perspective_query(
    query="How can cities implement smart transportation systems?",
    perspective_1="economic",
    perspective_2="environmental", 
    perspective_3="technological",
    universal_cot="Apply systematic reasoning...",
    chain_of_thought_1="Consider cost-benefit analysis...",
    chain_of_thought_2="Assess environmental impact...",
    chain_of_thought_3="Evaluate technical feasibility..."
)
```

### Enhanced CoT Usage
```python
from utils.chain_of_thought import ChainOfThoughtEnhancer

cot_enhancer = ChainOfThoughtEnhancer()

# Get pre-built guidance
universal_cot = cot_enhancer.get_universal_cot_guidance()
economic_cot = cot_enhancer.get_perspective_specific_guidance("economic")

# Use in analysis
result = await ensemble.process_multi_perspective_query(
    query=query,
    universal_cot=universal_cot,
    chain_of_thought_1=economic_cot,
    # ... other parameters
)
```
